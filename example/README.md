ðŸ›  Why It Matters for You

As an SRE:
	â€¢	You often need to simulate services to test observability, metrics, alerting, etc.
	â€¢	Flask lets you do that without waiting on devs or needing a full stack.
	â€¢	Itâ€™s great for building throwaway apps for testing dashboards, error rates, SLOs, and latency thresholds.
